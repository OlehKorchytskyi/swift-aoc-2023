# Advent of Code 2023

This project showcases my solutions for each day's challenge in Swift, following a structured format inspired by the [swift-aoc-starter-example](https://github.com/apple/swift-aoc-starter-example) template.

## Project Structure

- `Sources/` 
  - Each day's Swift file is organized here (e.g., `Day01.swift`).
  - `Data/` 
    - Input data files for each day (e.g., `Day01.txt`).
- `Tests/` 
  - Test files for each day (e.g., `Day01.swift`).

## How to Run

To run the solutions, you can use the following command:

```bash
swift run AdventOfCode <day> [--benchmark]
```

For example, to run the solution for Day 3 with benchmarking:

```bash
swift run AdventOfCode 3 --benchmark
```

## Acknowledgments

This project is based on the template from [swift-aoc-starter-example](https://github.com/apple/swift-aoc-starter-example). Special thanks to the contributors for providing a solid foundation.
