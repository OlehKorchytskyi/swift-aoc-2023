# Advent of Code 2023

This project showcases my solutions for each day's challenge in Swift.

## Project Structure

- `Sources/Data/Day##.txt`: the input data provided for the challenge;
- `Sources/Day##.swift`: the code to solve the challenge;
- `Tests/Day##.swift`: unit tests for par1 and part2 of the challenge.

## How to Run

To run the solutions, you can use the following command:

```bash
swift run AdventOfCode <day> [--benchmark]
```

For example, to run the solution for Day 3 with benchmarking:

```bash
swift run AdventOfCode 3 --benchmark
```
